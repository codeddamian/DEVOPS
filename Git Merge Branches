The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/apps.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage
server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

a. Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). 
Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.

STEP 1  -->  ssh into the Storage Server
SETP 2  -->cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps

STEP 3  --> git status and git branch # to confirm which branch you are on 
STEP 4  --> git checkout -b devops # Create and switch to the devops branch 
STEP 5  --> git branch #To confirm devops branch and see how many branches where created 
STEP 6  -->  cp /tmp/index.html /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps #Copy the file tothe directory <-
STEP 7  --> git add index.html  #moving the file to the staging area 
STEP 8. --> git commit -m "add html file". # commiting the file to the local repo

STEP 9  --> git checkout master # switching to the master branch 
STEP 10 -->  git merge devops # merging the devops branchearlier createdto the master brnach 
STEP 11 --> git push -u origin devops #pushing the file to the remote repo 
STEP 12 --> git push -u origin master #pushing the file to the remote repo
