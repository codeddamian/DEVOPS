The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/apps.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps.
Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes,
so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps repo add a new remote dev_apps and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git repository
b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.
c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

Solution: First login into the storage branch and switch to the root user 
navigate to the cloned directory : cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
Add remote repo : git remote add dev_apps /opt/xfusioncorp_apps.git
Copy HTML file from tmp to repo and add : cp /tmp/index.html .
git inititilize the new repo: git init 
Add and commit the index.html file  :  git add index.html
                                    git commit -m "add index.html"
                                    
Finally push the master branch to this new remote origin :git push -u dev_apps  master
