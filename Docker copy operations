The Nautilus DevOps team has some conditional data present on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter. 
There is a container ubuntu_latest running on the same server. We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container.
Below are more details about the task:

On App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from docker host to ubuntu_latest container (running on same server) 
in /usr/src/ location. Please do not try to modify this file in any way.



STEP 1 --> docker ps #To list running containers 
STEP 2 --> docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/usr/src  # To copy the file from the the docekr host tothe the ubunutu_latest container to the /usr/src locatio 
STEP 3 --> docker exec ubuntu_latest ls -ltr /usr/src # run a command in the existing ubuntu_latest runnig container and list the directory. 
STEP 4 --> docker
